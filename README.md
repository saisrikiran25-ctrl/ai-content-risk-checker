# AI Content Risk Checker ⚠️

> **Governance-first content review for content and marketing teams.**

A polished, production-quality web application that scans AI-assisted draft content for publishability and governance risks before it goes live. Built for content marketers, product marketers, editorial leads, brand reviewers, and content ops managers.

---

## 🔍 What It Does

Paste any draft — a blog post, landing page, paid ad, case study, social post, or email — and run a structured governance scan across 5 risk categories:

| Category | What It Checks |
|----------|---------------|
| **Claims Risk** | Unsupported stats, outcome guarantees, superlatives, certainty language |
| **Privacy Risk** | Personal data, email addresses, customer identifiers, PHI references |
| **Bias Risk** | Exclusionary wording, age-coded language, demographic generalizations |
| **Testimonial / Authenticity Risk** | Quote-style content, implied endorsements, unverified attribution |
| **Citation / Source Risk** | "Studies show" language, unsourced percentages, vague authority claims |

For every flag, the app explains **what was flagged**, **why it matters**, **how severe it is**, **which reviewers are required**, and **what action to take next**.

## ⚙️ Risk Engine

The scan combines:
- **Deterministic regex pattern matching** — 30+ rules across 5 categories
- **Context weighting** — multipliers by content type (paid ads score highest), workflow stage, and context tags
- **Weighted scoring model**: Claims (30%) · Citation (25%) · Testimonial (20%) · Privacy (15%) · Bias (10%)
- **Configurable governance rules** — thresholds, watch terms, reviewer mappings, and restricted content policies

Risk labels: **Low** (0–30) · **Medium** (31–59) · **High** (60–79) · **Critical** (80+)

## 🔀 Review Routing Logic

| Risk Level | Example Routing |
|------------|----------------|
| Low | Editor review |
| Medium | Editor + Content Lead |
| High | PMM + Legal/Compliance |
| Critical | Stop publish → Escalate to Legal/Compliance |

Plus automatic escalation for: privacy data exposure, unverified testimonials, founder voice content.

## 📦 Sample Draft Templates

The application starts with a clean slate for your organization's reviews. To test the live AI risk checker immediately, go to the **New Review** view and click the **"Load Sample"** button in the upper right corner. It will populate the editor with draft text containing various risk markers (such as absolute guarantees, personal emails, age-coded hiring descriptions, and unsourced statistics) for the AI scan engine to detect.
